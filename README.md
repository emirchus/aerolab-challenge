# Aerolab Frontend Developer coding challenge

The challenge is to build a catalog view for a loyalty program app. We‚Äôll provide you with the base UI and API, you can use it as provided or you can make any improvements you deem fit. It‚Äôs up to you, your imagination and your skills to come up with new solutions and/or interactions between the components.

Remember that the product‚Äôs main goal is to help users redeem items through a points-based system. We expect your end-product to be both visually attractive and functionally effective.
